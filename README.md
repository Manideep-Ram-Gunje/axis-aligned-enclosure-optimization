# üß† Axis-Aligned Enclosure Optimization

This repository contains four progressively optimized C++ solutions to the **Axis-Aligned Enclosure Optimization** problem.

> **Problem Statement**  
Given a set of `N` buildings (each with coordinates and a weight), design an axis-aligned, simple, closed polygon that encloses at least `K` buildings and minimizes:

Total Cost = Perimeter of the polygon + Sum of weights of enclosed buildings


A building is considered enclosed if it lies strictly inside or on the boundary of the polygon.

## üß© Constraints

- Polygon must be axis-aligned (edges parallel to X/Y axes)
- Polygon must be simple and closed (non-self-intersecting)
- Vertices may be floating points
- Weight `w·µ¢` of buildings can be negative
- 1 ‚â§ K ‚â§ N ‚â§ 10000

## üß™ Approach Summaries

### 1. `naive_rectangle.cpp`
- Enumerates all possible X and Y boundaries
- For each rectangle, counts enclosed buildings
- Optimizes based on total cost
- **Slow**, but works fine for small N

### 2. `optimized_rectangle.cpp`
- Based on sweeping strategies in Chan & Har-Peled's 2012 paper
- Uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate weight sums inside vertical slabs
- **Much faster** and scalable to large inputs

### 3. `randomized_approx.cpp`
- Implements a (1 + Œµ)-approximation
- Randomly samples subsets of buildings, constructs bounding rectangles
- Picks the one with best cost
- **Extremely fast**, especially when K is small

### 4. `hybrid_model.cpp`
- Merges rectangle approximation with polygonal enclosure
- Computes both rectangle and convex-hull-shaped polygon around sampled buildings
- Chooses the tighter one
- **Best balance** between accuracy and performance
